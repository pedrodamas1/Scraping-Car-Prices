# Used Car Price Prediction Project

![Used Car Price Prediction](img/standvirtual.png)

Welcome to the Used Car Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for scraping used car prices from the web, training a predictive model, and making accurate price predictions.

## Overview

This project is aimed at predicting used car prices using data scraped from various online sources. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Scraping**: Python scripts are used to scrape the web for used car listings, extracting essential features such as make, model, year, mileage, and price.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The scraped data undergoes thorough cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization techniques are applied to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between variables.

4. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Regression model is trained using Scikit-learn, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 88%.

5. **Model Deployment**: The trained model is saved for future use, allowing for real-world price predictions.

## Results

The predictive model demonstrates its efficacy by accurately predicting the price of a personally purchased car, highlighting its practical utility in the used car market.

## Future Work

In future iterations, we plan to:

- Experiment with different machine learning models
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
- Compare model performance with an Artificial Neural Network approach

## Getting Started
