I developed a Python project aimed at scraping the web for used car prices, storing all the acquired data locally. Following this, I engaged in data cleaning and visualization to prepare the dataset for model training using Scikit-learn. Utilizing a Random Forest pipeline, I fitted the data and achieved an impressive accuracy of 88%. Subsequently, the trained model was saved and deployed to predict the price of a car I personally purchased, yielding results that closely matched expectations.

This endeavor provided invaluable insights into the intricate market trends governing used car prices, which are influenced by a multitude of numerical and categorical variables. Moving forward, I aspire to explore different models, delve into hyperparameter tuning, and compare performance, potentially including an Artificial Neural Network model for enhanced predictive capabilities.
